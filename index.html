            <p>Hello everyone. For me, it is difficult to currently describe my career goals as I am not sure what career I really want.
                Something important for me however, is to be able to eventually find a job with decent enough pay, and good insurance benefits.
                One of my worst fears is having some sort of accident and not being able to pay for it. So as a result, if I were to find a job with these qualifications,
                then I would be able to alleviate these fears somewhat. Along with this, if I find a well paying job, I could have more freedom of which to spend my money.
                As I would love to live in the city, needing a stable and high income is almost necessary in order to find a good home in a good location.
            </p>
